* To-do list

** TODO Wrap more git-svn commands

   - [ ] init
   - [-] clone
     - [ ] Handle -s option properly.
     - [X] Handle -r option properly.
   - [ ] fetch
   - [ ] rebase

** TODO Major features

   - [ ] Look at the output from git-svn to make sure I really have all the
     options in the wrappers.
   - [ ] Get clones of git-svn repositories working (creating a clone with
   the Subversion repository as upstream, not the git-svn one).
   - [ ] Split out subdirectories as if they were externals
   - [ ] The actual external handling
   - [ ] Handle svn:ignore

** TODO Migration

   - [ ] Create a "migrate" command to convert svnhack's external handling
     to submodules.
   - [ ] Handle authors file.
   - [ ] Convert svn:ignore to .gitignore
